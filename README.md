Introduction to LLMs by exploring from scratch: word vectorization, neural networks for POS tagging, and feature models such as BERT.

The files are organized as follows: 1) word vectorization in Word_vectors.ipynb, 2) implementation of neural networks for POS tagging in NN_for_POS_tags.ipynb, and 3) BERT.ipynb, an exploration of the pre-trained model and finetuning it for different tasks.

The complimentary files are used as vocabularies/corpuses for the experiments in the notebooks.
